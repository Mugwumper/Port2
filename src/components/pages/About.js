          <h1>About</h1> 
          <p>Born and raised in Miami I've lived in Raleigh for most of my career.</p> 
          <p>I have worked on some amazing teams been part of successful waterfall style projects and have come to embrace the value of Agile.</p> 
          <p>I've worked remote, and as sole developer for a time as well. I know the value of communications and written documentation in all settings.</p> 
          <p>I am currently seeking a role in a remote position doing whatever needs to be done to get a project large or small completed. Meaning if I don't know the technology I'm willing to learn it.</p> 
          <p>My strengths are in writing code C#, Javascript, Python, database admin and in attention to detail, particularly where it concerns the user experiance.</p>
