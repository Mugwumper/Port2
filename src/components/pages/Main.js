      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Born and raised in Miami I've lived in Raleigh for most of my career.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked on some amazing teams been part of successful waterfall
        style projects and have come to embrace the value of Agile.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worked remote, and as sole developer for a time as well. I know the
        value of communications and written documentation in all settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently seeking a role in a remote position doing whatever needs
        to be done to get a project large or small completed. Meaning if I don't
        know the technology I'm willing to learn it.
      </p>
      <p>
        My strengths are in writing code such as C#, Javascript, Python,
        database admin and in attention to detail, particularly where it
        concerns the user experiance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This portfolio represents my latest effort to branch out into the world
        of web development.
